# Scrap Fleet Pilot Abilities

Each pilot has abilities they can use. To use an ability, discard a card from your scrap pile. Then select one of your pilots to use their ability.

Each attribute (Scan, Shots, Shields, Speed) grants a certain ability. Each pilot has the abilities of the attributes they have. Each ability has 3 levels, and the pilot’s level in that ability is dependent on the number they have in that attribute. For example, a pilot with 1 Aim, 1 Shield, and 1 Speed has the abilities of Aim, Shields, and Speed at level 1. A pilot with 2 Aim and 1 Shields has the abilities of Aim at level 2 and Shields at level 1. A pilot with 3 Shields has the ability of Shields at level 3.

When a pilot activates one of their abilities, if they have more than one level in it, they activate the ability at level 1, then level 2, then level 3 (up to the level that have in it). They activate the ability in the lower levels first, then activate the ability in the level they have in it. You still activate higher level abilities even if the lower level ones you need to activate first have requirements that are not met. Abilities always cost 1 scrap regardless of what level it is.

Abilities can be played as reactions, and they can be played regardless of whose turn it is.

If multiple players use a pilot ability as an action, the ability that was activated last gets processed first. However, if a player uses an ability as a reaction, then other abilities cannot be activated until the reaction ability is resolved.

In the following ability descriptions, “components” refers to both basic components and pilots, but not shields or space cards.

# Scan

Scan 1 – Select a ship and an attribute (Scan, Shots, Shields, Speed). The player has to reveal an unrevealed component that has that attribute on that ship.

Scan 2 – Select a player and an attribute (Scan, Shots, Shields, Speed). That player has to reveal an unrevealed component that has that attribute on each of their ships.

Scan 3 – Select an attribute (Scan, Shots, Shields, Speed). Every player has to choose a ship and reveal an unrevealed component that has that attribute on that ship.

# Shots

Shots 1 – Choose a ship. Destroy a card from that ship.  
If the ship has revealed shields, you must choose a revealed shield.  
If you destroyed a space card, return the space card to the ship.

Shots 2 - Choose a ship. Destroy a card from that ship.  
If the ship has revealed shields, you must choose a revealed shield. If a shield is destroyed with this shot, you may destroy one more revealed shield.  
If you destroyed a space card, return the space card to the ship.

Shots 3 – Choose a ship. Destroy a card from that ship.   
If the ship has revealed shields, you must choose a revealed shield.  
If you destroyed a space card, return the space card to the ship.  
If you destroy that ship, make an attack on another ship.

# Shields

Shields 1 – Reveal any number of shields on this ship. If this is used as a reaction to a component on this ship being destroyed, that component is instead not destroyed and a shield is destroyed instead. You must have shields left to activate this ability.

Shields 2 – Regenerate all your shields to your max. You may regenerate them revealed or not revealed. If this is used as a reaction to a component on this ship being destroyed, that component is instead not destroyed and a shield is destroyed instead.

Shields 3 – Add shields to your ship equal to your max Shields.

# Speed

Speed 1 – Unreveal a revealed component on this ship. If this is used as a reaction to a component on this ship being destroyed, that component is instead not destroyed. You may shuffle your ship’s deck. If the next shot against this ship misses (destroys a space card), return the scrap you spent on this ability to your scrap pile.

Speed 2 – Unreveal all revealed components on this ship. For each component unrevealed this way, add a space card to this ship.

Speed 3 – Add a space cards to this ship equal to this ship’s Speed.
